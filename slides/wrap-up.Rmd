# Agenda

1. Finish your data exploration (30 min)

2. Share your progress with your group (30 min)

3. Wrap-up (recap and resources) (30 min)

---
# Finish your data exploration

* **Import your data** into R (anyone working with files formats other than .csv?)

* **Compute summary statistics** to better understand your data -- what types of variables do you have? How much variation is there within certain variables of interest?

* **Follow your curiosity** -- what relationships do you want to explore? Come up with one or two questions to investigate.

* **Create at least one plot and one table** to explore patterns of covariation in the data

* (Optional) **Create a rendered Quarto report**. Add formatting to your document and experiment with different output formats

## `r emo::ji("clock")` Until 4:00 PM

---
# Share your work

* What did you learn? Where did you struggle? 

* Pick one plot or table and walk through how you created it

## `r emo::ji("clock")` Until 4:30 PM

---
# Wrap-up

1. Resources + Best practices 

2. Continuing education

3. Conference schedule

4. Feedback survey
