Welcome to this in-person component of Introduction to Data Science with R with Posit Academy. You are all here because you're invested in learning R and making sure it sticks. You've already taken a huge step forward toward that goal over the last 5 weeks with Posit Academy. 

Our goal today is guide you through some opportunities to practice your R skills and take advantage of being together in person to dive deeper into topics that interest you.

You should now have access to a few more "milestones" in your campsite if you scroll to the 
right. You can ignore the word "weeks"

Finally --  throughout the workshop, we'll use sticky notes to signal either being done with an activity or needing help. 

* You should place a green sticky on your laptop if youâ€™re done with an exercise and a pink sticky if you want help. [CLICK]

* You can use pink stickies at anytime during the session to signal that you're stuck, lost, or would like help.

* We will be on the lookout for stickies throughout each session.

* Insurance 

* Manufacturing/Supply Chain/Logistics

* ... other?

Another cool thing about this workshop is that it brings you all together from a wide variety of professional 
backgrounds, all with a similar goal, of learning R. 

You've gotten to know each other a little bit over the past month in your smaller 
groups, but since this is the first time everyone is together, I wanted to help you 
all get a better sense of who's in the room.

---
class: inverse

# Form small groups (2 - 3)

* Working together will be a theme of the day

* Introduce yourself to your neighbor(s)
  
  1. Name, location, job role (how do you work with data?)

  2. `r emo::ji("pig")` or `r emo::ji("goat")`?  If you had to choose, **would you rather have a pet pig or a pet goat**, and why? (This will become relevant, I swear.)

???

You are all coming from a variety of professional backgrounds and levels of experience with R and programming -- awesome!
