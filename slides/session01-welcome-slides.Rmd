You've heard us say this before...

At Posit Academy, we believe that learning any new skill (whether its musical, computational, athletic -- *really any new skill*) is not simply about memorizing new facts...

By being here the next two days, you are checking off all of these boxes in some form. And you happen to be doing this for a skillset that is both highly valuable and versatile. 

You can take your coding and data science skills with you to any job 
-- and apply them to goals both professional and personal.

# Goals

???

For the next two days, our goals are to support you in this by allowing for more group work, exposure to new projects and datasets, and more engagement with us. Specifically...[CLICK]

1. Practice with some familiar wrangling skills and explore new ones [CLICK]

1. Learn best practices for exploring your data and reporting it reproducibly

In short, we hope the next two days allow you to do a deep-dive into the skills you've been learning the past few weeks, to apply new skills you'll learn, and take advantage of a lot of protected time for practice.

Finally --  throughout the workshop, we'll use sticky notes to signal either being done with an activity or needing help. 

* You should place a green sticky on your laptop if youâ€™re done with an exercise and a pink sticky if you want help. [CLICK]

* You can use pink stickies at anytime during the session to signal that you're stuck, lost, or would like help.

* We will be on the lookout for stickies throughout each session.
