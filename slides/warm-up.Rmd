What we'll do:

I'm going to give you a prompt with a short tidyverse task, and you'll work to recreate it. 

You'll do your work in the Quarto document you have open so you have a record of your code. You can create as many new code chunks as you like in here. 


---

<!-- TODO: update -->

# Review challenge

* __Working together__ with your groupmates is encouraged.

--

* After 1-2 minutes, we'll go over the answer together. And then move on to the next question. 

--

* Everyone gets a small prize at the end! `r emo::ji("tada")`

???

Working together is okay (and encouraged)

We'll go over the answer once I see that most people have finished.

There are 20 prompts -- we may get through all of them (or not). But there will be a prize for everyone at the end.

I should also note that there's a bit of a mish mash of difficulty. But The main idea is that you exercise some tidyverse recall and get warmed up.

# .big-text[`outbreaks`]

???

We'll be working with data about foodborne and waterborne disease outbreaks spread by contact with environmental sources or infected people or animals. I'll refer to this data set as `outbreaks`. It comes from the CDC's National Outbreak Reporting System (NORS).

First things first, let's take a look a what's in this data set. 

So *here* is your first prompt:

---
class: your-turn

# Your Turn 1

Read in the data and explore it. Can you recreate output that looks like this?

```{r read-in-outbreaks, include = FALSE}
outbreaks <- readr::read_csv("data/session01/outbreaks.csv")
```

.space-saver[
```{r echo = FALSE}
glimpse(outbreaks)
#str(outbreaks)
```
]

???

1 minute

---

## Solution 1
.pull-left[
```{r sol-1, eval = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

outbreaks <- 
  read_csv("data/outbreaks.csv")

glimpse(outbreaks)
```
]

.pull-right.space-saver[
```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
glimpse(outbreaks)
```
]

---
class: your-turn

# Your Turn 2

What is the **earliest year** on record in this data set? __The latest__? 

Answer the questions by creating two tables that are sorted.

---

## Solution 2

.pull-left[
```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
outbreaks %>%
  arrange(year)
```

.space-saver[
```{r echo = FALSE}
outbreaks %>%
  arrange(year) %>% 
  reactable_preview()
```
]
]

.pull-right[
```{r eval = FALSE}
outbreaks %>%
  arrange(desc(year))
```

.space-saver[
```{r echo = FALSE}
outbreaks %>%
  arrange(desc(year)) %>% 
  reactable_preview()
```
]
]

---
class: your-turn

# Your Turn 3

The `state` variable appears to include US locations -- is the data limited to the 50 states? 

Produce a table that displays all the unique values of this variable.


---

## Solution 3

```{r sol-3, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
outbreaks %>%
  distinct(state)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
outbreaks %>%
  distinct(state) %>% 
  reactable_preview()
```

---
class: your-turn

# Your Turn 4

What are the different etiologies that have been recorded in this data set, and how often do they appear in the data? Display your results in a table like the one below.

```{r echo = FALSE}
outbreaks %>%
  count(etiology) %>% 
  reactable_preview()
```

---

## Solution 4

```{r eval = FALSE}
outbreaks %>%
  count(etiology)
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
outbreaks %>%
  count(etiology) %>% 
  reactable_preview()
```


---
class: your-turn

# Your Turn 5

Let's turn our attention to only observations where the primary mode of infection is Food. Using that criterion, can you reproduce the table below? 

**Note:** `ifsac_category` refers to food category (IFSAC = Interagency Food Safety Analytics Collaboration, part of the CDC)

```{r echo = FALSE}
outbreaks %>%
  filter(primary_mode == "Food") %>% 
  count(ifsac_category) %>% 
  reactable_preview()
```

???

---

## Solution 5

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
outbreaks %>%
  filter(primary_mode == "Food") %>% 
  count(ifsac_category)
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
outbreaks %>%
  filter(primary_mode == "Food") %>% 
  count(ifsac_category) %>% 
  reactable_preview()
```


---
class: your-turn

# Your Turn 6

.pull-left[
Explore the relationship between `month` and the number of illnesses with a series of **boxplots** like the one to the right. Can you recreate it? 

**Hint:** Try using the `group` aesthetic to tell R that you'd like to create a boxplot for each unique value of `month`.
]

.pull-right[
```{r sol-6, echo = FALSE}
outbreaks %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = month, y = illnesses)) + 
  geom_boxplot(aes(group = month)) #<<
```
]


???

Check documentation for use of the argument that allows you to create a new boxplot for each grouping.

---

## Solution 6

.wide-left[
```{r ref.label = "sol-6", fig.show = "hide"}
```

The outlier here makes it hard to see what's going on. Let's modify this.

]

.narrow-right[
```{r ref.label = "sol-6", echo = FALSE}
```
]

???

But the outlier here makes it hard to see what's going on. Let's modify this.

---
class: your-turn

# Your Turn 7

The outlier we just observed represents the outbreak associated with the highest number of illnesses. Which observation is this?

  1. Display **only** this observation in a table. 

  2. Then, recreate the boxplots **without** this observation.
  
Here is the code we just used to make the boxplots in the last exercise:

```{r eval=FALSE}
outbreaks %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = month, y = illnesses)) + 
  geom_boxplot(aes(group = month))
```


---
class: space-saver

## Solution 7

.pull-left[

```{r eval = FALSE}
outbreaks %>%
  filter(illnesses == max(illnesses))
```

]

.pull-right[
```{r echo = FALSE}
outbreaks %>%
  filter(illnesses == max(illnesses)) %>% 
  reactable_preview()
```

<br>

]

--

.pull-left[
```{r sol-7-fig, fig.asp = 1/2, fig.show = "hide"}
outbreaks %>%
  filter(illnesses != max(illnesses)) %>% #<<
  ggplot(aes(x = month, y = illnesses)) + 
  geom_boxplot(aes(group = month))
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label= "sol-7-fig", echo = FALSE, fig.asp = 3/5}

```

]

---
class: your-turn

# Your Turn 8

Which outbreaks lead to the highest number of illnesses? 

Display these observations in a table from greatest to fewest illnesses:

```{r echo = FALSE}
outbreaks %>% arrange(desc(illnesses)) %>% 
  reactable_preview()
```


---
class: space-saver

## Solution 8

```{r eval = FALSE}
outbreaks %>% arrange(desc(illnesses))
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
outbreaks %>% arrange(desc(illnesses)) %>% 
  reactable_preview()
```


---
class: your-turn

# Your Turn 9

How many different primary modes of illness are in this data set? How often does each appear in the data?

Order the rows so that the most common primary mode appears at the top. 

---

## Solution 9

```{r eval = FALSE}
outbreaks %>%
  count(primary_mode, sort = TRUE)
```

or...

```{r eval = FALSE}
outbreaks %>%
  count(primary_mode) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
outbreaks %>%
  count(primary_mode) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) %>% 
  reactable_preview()
```

???

Looks like the most common primary mode for outbreaks in this particular data set is person-to-person.

---
class: your-turn

# Your Turn 10

.pull-left[Can you recreate this visualization of the **primary modes** of infection?

_Hint:_ Look up the help page for `coord_flip()`.
]

.pull-right[
```{r echo = FALSE}
outbreaks %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = primary_mode)) + 
  geom_bar() +
  coord_flip() 
```
]

???

---

## Solution 10

.pull-left[
```{r sol-10, eval = FALSE}
outbreaks %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = primary_mode)) + 
  geom_bar() +
  coord_flip() #<<
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "sol-10", echo = FALSE}

```
]

???

Notice coord_flip()

If your first inclination was to use count() then you might have come up with an answer like...

---

## Solution 10 - alternative

.wide-left[
```{r sol-10-alt, eval = FALSE}
outbreaks %>%
  count(primary_mode, name = "count") %>% #<<
  ggplot(aes(x = primary_mode, y = count)) + 
  geom_col() + #<<
  coord_flip()
```
]

.narrow-right[
```{r ref.label = "sol-10-alt", echo = FALSE}

```
]

???

This one, but it's a little less efficient code-wise.

---
class: your-turn

# Your Turn 11 

Let's take a closer look at outbreaks for which the primary mode of infection is **Animal Contact**. 

How many Animal Contact outbreaks has each _individual_ state had? Recreate the table below.

```{r echo = FALSE}
outbreaks %>% 
  filter(
    primary_mode == "Animal Contact",
    state != "Multistate"
  ) %>% 
  count(state, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  reactable_preview()
```

_Hint_: You will need to remove observations where `state` is equal to "Multistate".


---

## Solution 11

```{r eval = FALSE}
outbreaks %>% 
  filter(
    primary_mode == "Animal Contact",
    state != "Multistate"
  ) %>% 
  count(state, sort = TRUE)
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
outbreaks %>% 
  filter(
    primary_mode == "Animal Contact",
    state != "Multistate"
  ) %>% 
  count(state, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  reactable_preview()
```

---
class: your-turn

# Your Turn 12

.left-column35[
Now that we know the top 3 states are **Ohio**, **Minnesota**, and **Idaho**, recreate this table:

* Has only the Animal Contact outbreaks for those locations  

* Column names with "animal" appear after `state`

* Drop the `primary_mode` column
]

.right-column63.space-saver[
```{r sol-12, echo = FALSE}
outbreaks %>%
  filter(
    primary_mode == "Animal Contact", 
    state %in% c("Ohio", "Minnesota", "Idaho")
  ) %>% 
  relocate(
    contains("animal"), 
    .after = state
  ) %>% 
  select(-primary_mode) %>% 
  reactable_preview()
```
]

---
class: space-saver

## Solution 12

```{r eval = FALSE}
outbreaks %>%
  filter(
    primary_mode == "Animal Contact", 
    state %in% c("Ohio", "Minnesota", "Idaho")
  ) %>% 
  relocate(
    contains("animal"), 
    .after = state
  ) %>% 
  select(-primary_mode)
```

```{r ref.label = "sol-12", echo = FALSE}

```

# Your Turn 13

.pull-left[Visualize the relationship between **year** and number of **illnesses** with a smooth line plot:

* Before you plot, exclude the outlier we previously identified (the outbreak with the max number of illnesses). 

* Color each line by its primary mode.]

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
outbreaks %>%
  filter(illnesses != max(illnesses)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y = illnesses, x = year, color = primary_mode)) +

## Solution 13

.pull-left[
```{r sol-13, eval = FALSE, message = FALSE}

]


---
class: your-turn

# Your Turn 14

Visualize the number of illnesses in **Washington DC**, grouped by **primary mode** of infection using a "violin plot". *Hint:* You may need to investigate `geom_violin()`.

(Don't worry if your plot dimensions look different than the plot below.)

```{r sol-14, echo = FALSE, fig.height = 4.5, fig.width = 11, out.width = "70%"}
outbreaks %>% 
  filter(state == "Washington DC") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = primary_mode, y = illnesses)) +
  geom_violin(aes(color = primary_mode)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3) # any alpha value < 1 is OK
```

---

## Solution 14


```{r ref.label = "sol-14", fig.show = "hide", message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
```


```{r ref.label = "sol-14", echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.height = 4.5, fig.width = 11, out.width = "75%", warning = FALSE}
```

---
class: your-turn

# Your Turn 15

Let's focus only on **Washington DC** and **food borne illnesses**. Show the most recent outbreaks in a table from most recent to least recent.

_Hint_: Which two columns contain date information?

```{r echo=FALSE}

    state == "Washington DC" & 
    primary_mode == "Food"
    ) %>%
  arrange(desc(year), desc(month)) %>%
